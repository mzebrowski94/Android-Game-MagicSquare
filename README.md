#### Hello :wave:

###### This repository contains my first andorid app - Magic Square Game.
In mathematics and combinatorial design, a magic square is a n Ã— n square grid (where n is the number of cells on each side) filled with distinct positive integers in the range 1 , 2 , . . . , n^2 such that each cell contains a different integer. 

In this magic square variant player must fill the square in such a way that the sum of the numbers in the rows and columns is equal to the given value.

**Technologies and tools:**
